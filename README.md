# SLR-210: Blockchain: algorithmic basics
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course IMA-208 at Télécom Paris

Understanding of the algorithmic foundations behind the blockchain technology:

We study the algorithmic basics behind decentralized and consistent storage systems that tolerate churn and malicious behavior of participating nodes.  We begin with the study of classical protocols for reconfigurable storage and Byzantine fault-tolerance. Then we explore the protocols designed for "open" systems, exemplified by the prominent blockchain technology.
